# Generals.io.2.0
Recreation of a game I used to love playing during class in high school
First of all, this is my current labor of love, so it is not quite done yet! But please feel free to check it out where
it stands!
# A Couple Notes
Game.java is the main function here, runnning this will create the instances of everything else in the game. The GamePanel is where all the love is at, so if you want to check things out head on over into there :wink:

# What I've learned
- I've created a custom tile system
- Use of an array of arrays to store a map of tiles
- Moving entries between arrays upon user key strokes
